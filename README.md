# Python-Obfuscastor
This Python script is designed to obfuscate and encrypt Python source code files. It uses a combination of compression and encoding techniques to make the original code difficult to read or reverse engineer. The obfuscation process enhances the security of the code, making it harder for unauthorized users to understand or modify it.
